    "Це означає, що модель правильно класифікує лише 25% зразків тестової вибірки. Такий результат свідчить про низьку точність моделі та вказує на необхідність покращення її роботи.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Можливі причини низької точності:\n",
    "1. **Недостатня складність моделі**:\n",
    "   - Модель може бути занадто простою для задачі, з недостатньою кількістю шарів або нейронів, що заважає їй навчитись розрізняти жанри музики.\n",
    "   \n",
    "2. **Незбалансовані класи**:\n",
    "   - Якщо в наборі даних деякі класи представлені набагато більше, ніж інші, модель може навчатися на частіші класи і не давати точних результатів для рідкісних класів.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Неоптимізовані параметри моделі**:\n",
    "   - Параметри моделі, такі як кількість епох, розмір батчу, кількість нейронів у шарах, можуть бути не оптимальними.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Особливості даних**:\n",
    "   - Якщо в даних є багато шуму або відсутні важливі ознаки, це може вплинути на якість моделі.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Кроки для покращення точності:\n",
    "1. **Збільшення складності моделі**:\n",
    "   - Додати більше шарів або нейронів у модель.\n",
    "   - Додати шар **Dropout** для уникнення переобучення.\n",
    "   \n",
    "2. **Регулювання гіперпараметрів**:\n",
    "   - Спробувати збільшити кількість епох, змінити розмір батчу або використовувати різні оптимізатори, такі як **RMSprop** або **SGD**.\n",
    "   - Експериментувати з іншими функціями активації (наприклад, **tanh** або **LeakyReLU**).\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Перевірка балансування класів**:\n",
    "   - Перевірити чи є баланс у класах. Якщо класи сильно дисбалансовані, можна використовувати техніки боротьби з дисбалансом, такі як **oversampling** або **undersampling**.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Аугментація даних**:\n",
    "   - Для числових або категоріальних даних можна створювати синтетичні дані для покращення різноманітності тренувальної вибірки.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Тонка настройка гіперпараметрів**:\n",
    "   - Використовувати техніки, як **GridSearchCV** або **RandomizedSearchCV**, для пошуку оптимальних гіперпараметрів моделі.\n",
    "\n",
    "Змінивши налаштування моделі та покращивши баланс класів, можна досягти кращих результатів на тестовій вибірці.\n"
